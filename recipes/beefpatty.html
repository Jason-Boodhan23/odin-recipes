    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ground beef: The main protein for the filling, cooked with spices and herbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion: A finely chopped onion adds flavor to the beef filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garlic: Fresh garlic helps build the flavor base for the patty filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scotch bonnet pepper: For that authentic Jamaican heat. Use more or less
        depending on your spice tolerance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thyme: A traditional herb used in Jamaican cooking for its earthy, aromatic flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Curry powder: This gives the patty its signature yellow color and distinct flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Panko breadcrumbs: To absorb any excess moisture and help bind the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beef broth: Adds moisture and richness to the beef mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: The butter is key to making the dough flaky and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        All-purpose flour: The base for the patty dough, mixed with spices for flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: To help bind the dough and add richness to the crust.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the beef filling:</strong> Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the ground beef until browned. Add the onion, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper, and cook until softened. Stir in thyme, curry powder, panko breadcrumbs, and beef broth. Let it simmer until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the patty dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine flour, turmeric, salt, and curry powder. Cut in cold butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add a little cold water and mix until a dough forms. Knead lightly and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the patties:</strong> Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into circles (about 6 inches in diameter). Place a spoonful of the cooled beef mixture in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork for a decorative touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg wash and bake:</strong> Brush the tops of the patties with beaten egg for a golden, shiny finish. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
      </li>
    </ol>
