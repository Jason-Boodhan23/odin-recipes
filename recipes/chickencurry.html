    <h2>Homemade Chicken Curry</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken curry recipe is rich, flavorful, and full of spices. The tender
      chicken is cooked in a creamy, aromatic curry sauce made with a blend of spices
      like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Serve with steamed basmati rice
      or naan for a comforting and hearty meal.
